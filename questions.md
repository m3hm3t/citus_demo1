Hello everyone, I'm Mehmet YÄ±lmaz. I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft, currently focused on advancing the Citus project to deliver a robust and scalable database solution.


I first got interested in Citus when I saw how it boosts PostgreSQL's reliable, open-source strengths to handle big data challenges. It blends a solid base with a creative twist, perfectly fitting today's fast-moving tech world. I'm really excited to join a team that loves pushing limits and solving real problems while having a great time doing it.



I find PostgreSQL fascinating because it's reliable and very flexible. It's open source, so a supportive community is always working to make it better. I love that it works well for both small projects and large applications. This mix of dependability and adaptability really stands out to me.
