What got me hooked on Citus was seeing how it takes the rock-solid, open-source charm of PostgreSQL and amps it up for big, bold data challenges. It's like getting the best of both worldsâ€”a dependable foundation mixed with a creative, innovative twist that just makes sense for today's fast-paced tech world. I'm super excited to be here, working with a team that's all about pushing boundaries and having fun while solving real-world problems.
